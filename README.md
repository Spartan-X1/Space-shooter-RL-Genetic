## 🔧 Configuration

Key gameplay parameters can be adjusted in `settings.py`:

```python
WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT = 1800, 980  # Display resolution
ENEMY_SPEED = 150                        # Base enemy movement speed
PLAYER_SPEED = 500                       # Player movement speed
LASER_SPEED = 600                        # Projectile velocity
ENEMY_SPAWN_INTERVAL = 3                 # Wave timing control
```
