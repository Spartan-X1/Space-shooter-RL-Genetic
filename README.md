## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Systems
- **Game Loop**: Killing enemies in the current wave & surviving
- **Entity Management**: Efficient sprite pooling and lifecycle management
- **Physics**: Custom collision detection with spatial optimization
- **Audio**: Audio & Music dynamic play for each senario

### Advanced Features
- **Wave Progression**: Fixed progress mechanism for each wave.
- **Enemy AI**: Smart constraint-based AI that combines movement patterns, boundary management, and player tracking to create emergent tactical behaviors
- **Weapon Balance**: Carefully tuned damage, rate of fire, and cooldown systems
- **Visual Effects**: Particle systems for explosions and projectile trails

## 🔧 Configuration

Key gameplay parameters can be adjusted in `settings.py`:

```python
WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT = 1800, 980  # Display resolution
ENEMY_SPEED = 150                        # Base enemy movement speed
PLAYER_SPEED = 500                       # Player movement speed
LASER_SPEED = 600                        # Projectile velocity
ENEMY_SPAWN_INTERVAL = 3                 # Wave timing control
```
