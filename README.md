# 🧠 Adaptive Game AI: Reinforcement Learning & Evolutionary Enemies

This project is an **AI sandbox** that brings together **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** and **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** in a game-like simulation. It demonstrates how modern AI can **learn, adapt, and evolve strategies** dynamically — the player is trained via reinforcement learning while enemies evolve genetically to counter the player.

Think of it as **chess between two AIs**: one learns by experience, the other adapts by evolution.

## 🤖 Core AI Components

### 🚀 Reinforcement Learning Agent
- **Dueling Deep Q-Network (DQN)** – separates state value and action advantage, improving stability.
- **Attention Module** – simplified self-attention to focus on critical features in the game state.
- **Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)** – samples important experiences more frequently for faster convergence.
- **Double DQN** – reduces overestimation bias when selecting optimal actions.
- **Action Masking** – prevents illogical actions (e.g., firing with no enemies in front).
- **Intrinsic Motivation** – novelty-based rewards to encourage exploration of unseen states.
- **Temporal State Tracking** – history buffers capture velocities & movement patterns for better decision-making.

### 👾 Genetic Algorithm (for Enemies)
- **Genome Encoding** – speed, health, aggressiveness, firing rate, formation cohesion, and evasion tendencies.
- **Selection Mechanisms** – tournament-based selection favors higher-fitness genomes.
- **Crossover & Mutation** – new generations combine traits and introduce diversity.
- **Fitness Function** – balances multiple factors:
  - 🕒 survival time
  - 🎯 accuracy & hit rate
  - 💥 damage dealt
  - ⚡ efficiency of attack
- **Emergent Behavior** – over generations, enemies develop tactics like spacing, aggression bursts, or evasion.

### 🌊 Neural Wave Manager
- **Adaptive Wave Generation** – adjusts enemy composition dynamically via neural network guidance.
- **Curriculum-Like Difficulty Scaling** – waves get progressively more complex as both player and enemies improve.
